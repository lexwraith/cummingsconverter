cummingsconverter
=================

A small program that translates a short piece of writing into an E. E. Cummings-style transliteration.

V1.1: Added argparse.
V1.0: Basic functionality is in - can fully convert a sample .txt into a full-out Cummings Cubism-style poem.

TODO:
Change argparse to accept arguments as actual parameters rather than just
	booleans.
Implement recursive chunking/tabbing abstraction, since they are awfully similar.
