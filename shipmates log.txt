Am I but a mere slave,
Chained to an erratic oar,
To viciously fight the elusive waves?
Or am I the venerable captain,
Manipulating the crooked rudder,
And turbulently moving towards still waters?
From one starry night,
To the next northern lights,
My ship has been going in circles,
Chasing a phantasm, a cretin of my own design.
I know not, where I am,
I know not, what I can be.
A fool, I am, to venture,
Where there be dragons.
